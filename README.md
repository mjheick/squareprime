# squareprime
A wild and crazy theory that proposes that prime share patterns in grids...

# What this be?
A basic example of javascript calculating primes and displaying them on a custom grid.

# What theory?
There isn't really a theory. I just believed that primes could show up in patterns when placed in a grid, just have to find the grid and the patterns.
